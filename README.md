  <!-- Design Decisions -->
  <div id="design-decisions">
    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
    <div id="how-do-i-approach-designing-software">
      <h3>How do I approach designing software?</h3>
      <blockquote>When I start designing software, my first priority is to thoroughly understand the problem I’m trying to solve. I focus heavily on the user’s needs, ensuring the software will be intuitive and efficient. I break the project down into smaller, manageable tasks and create a roadmap that guides the entire development process. While functionality is always at the forefront, I also think about scalability and maintainability, making sure the design can adapt and evolve over time.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="what-new-design-skills-has-your-work-on-the-project-helped-you-to-craft">
      <h3>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</h3>
      <blockquote>This project has really sharpened my skills in thinking critically about user interfaces and user experiences (UI/UX). I’ve learned how to balance the technical constraints of software development with the need for a clean, user-friendly design. I’ve also gotten better at integrating feedback loops into the design process, which has been crucial for continuous improvement based on user input.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="what-design-process-did-you-follow-for-your-project-work">
      <h3>What design process did you follow for your project work?</h3>
      <blockquote>I followed an iterative design process. It started with brainstorming and gathering requirements, then moved on to creating wireframes and prototypes. I tested these prototypes, gathered feedback, and made adjustments as needed. This cycle of designing, testing, and refining ensured that the final product closely matched user needs and expectations.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="how-could-tactics-from-your-design-approach-be-applied-in-future-work">
      <h3>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</h3>
      <blockquote>The iterative design approach I used can definitely be applied to future projects by focusing on continuous user testing and feedback. This method allows for flexibility and adaptation, ensuring that the final product stays relevant and effective. Also, maintaining clear communication and thorough documentation throughout the design process will be beneficial in any future work, helping keep projects on track and aligned with the original vision.</blockquote>

  <!-- Development Approach -->
  <div id="development-approach">
    <h2>Development Approach</h2>
    <div id="how-do-i-approach-developing-programs">
      <h3>How do I approach developing programs?</h3>
            <blockquote>My approach to program development is methodical and structured. I start with a thorough analysis of the requirements, then design an architecture that’s both robust and adaptable. I prioritize writing clean, efficient code and frequently test my work to catch any issues early on. I also make sure to document my code extensively so that it’s understandable and maintainable by others in the future.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="what-new-development-strategies-did-you-use-while-working-on-your-3d-scene">
      <h3>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</h3>
      <blockquote>While working on my 3D scene, I implemented modular programming, which allowed me to break down the complex scene into manageable components. I also made better use of version control, which helped me track changes and collaborate more effectively. On top of that, I adopted a more rigorous testing process, ensuring that each part of the scene rendered correctly before moving on to the next.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="how-did-iteration-factor-into-your-development">
      <h3>How did iteration factor into your development?</h3>
      <blockquote>Iteration was a key part of my development process. I regularly reviewed and refined my code, making improvements based on testing results and feedback. This iterative approach allowed me to gradually build up the complexity of my 3D scene, making sure each element worked perfectly before adding new features.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="how-has-your-approach-to-developing-code-evolved-throughout-the-milestones-which-led-you-to-the-projects-completion">
      <h3>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?</h3>
      <blockquote>As the project progressed, my approach to coding became more disciplined and systematic. I learned the importance of setting clear milestones and using them to guide the development process. I also got better at anticipating potential issues and planning for them in advance, which helped reduce the number of surprises and setbacks along the way.</blockquote>

  <!-- Future Goals -->
  <div id="computer-science-and-future-goals">
    <h2>Computer Science and Future Goals</h2>
    <div id="how-can-computer-science-help-me-in-reaching-my-goals">
      <h3>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</h3>
      <blockquote>Computer science gives me the foundational knowledge and technical skills needed to tackle complex problems and create tailored solutions towards the end user. It empowers me to build software that can automate tasks, analyze data, and create engaging digital experiences. By mastering computer science, I’m setting myself up to become a proficient developer, contribute to cutting-edge projects, and make a meaningful impact in my field.</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="how-do-computational-graphics-and-visualizations-give-you-new-knowledge-and-skills-that-can-be-applied-in-your-future-educational-pathway">
      <h3>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</h3>
      <blockquote>Computational graphics and visualizations have taught me how to represent complex data visually, making it easier to analyze and understand. These skills are crucial in fields like data science, where visualization is key to uncovering insights. In my future studies, these skills will help me tackle more advanced topics, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, where data representation plays a significant role.</blockquote>

    <div id="how-do-computational-graphics-and-visualizations-give-you-new-knowledge-and-skills-that-can-be-applied-in-your-future-professional-pathway">
      <h3>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</h3>
      <blockquote>In a professional setting, being able to create compelling visualizations is incredibly valuable. It allows me to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively, whether in presentations, reports, or interactive applications. The experience I’ve gained in computational graphics equips me with the tools to contribute to industries like gaming, virtual reality, and data analytics, where visually representing information is crucial.</blockquote>
